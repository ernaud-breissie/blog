Jubensha, often known as script murder games or murder mystery games, are a form of interactive role-playing game. Originating from East Asia, particularly popular in China, they have gained worldwide attention. In these games, players typically take on specific character roles, each with their own backgrounds, personalities, and secrets. The fundamental premise involves a murder mystery that the players must solve collaboratively.

Key characteristics of jubensha games include:

1. **Story-Driven Gameplay**: The game revolves around a scripted story, often intricate and involving various subplots. The players' actions and decisions can influence the direction and outcome of the story.

2. **Role-Playing**: Each player assumes the role of a character in the story. These characters are usually well-developed, with their own motivations, secrets, and relationships with other characters.

3. **Murder Mystery**: Central to the game is a murder or a series of murders. Players must work together to gather clues, interrogate each other, and solve the mystery.

4. **Immersive Experience**: Jubensha games often emphasize an immersive experience. This can include detailed settings, props, and sometimes costumes, encouraging players to fully inhabit their characters.

5. **Social Interaction and Deduction**: The games heavily rely on player interaction, discussion, and deduction. Players must analyze information, deduce motives, and uncover lies to solve the mystery.

6. **Variety in Themes and Settings**: While the core element is a murder mystery, jubensha games can vary widely in themes and settings, ranging from historical periods to fantasy worlds.

7. **No Physical Activity Required**: Unlike LARP (Live Action Role-Playing), jubensha games are usually played around a table or in a limited space, focusing more on dialogue and decision-making rather than physical activity.

Jubensha games offer a unique combination of storytelling, role-playing, and puzzle-solving, making them appealing to a wide range of players interested in narrative-driven games and collaborative problem-solving.
